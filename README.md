## Description

Minefield is a very simple game made with unity. It is constitute of an arena, a player (represented by a big sphere), and some mines which are invisible.
When you get closer to a mine, it starts biping. The fastest it bip, the closest to the mine you are. Your goal is to go to the destination without blowing up!

Hope you will enjoy it, feel free to contribute.
